# D3 - SlaughterData

In my project, I have created two web-based data visualisation applications using the D3.JS library. Through years at university, I have been focus mainly on games programming so this topic was a bit challenging to me. Discovering different point of view at programming and gaining more flexibility made me a better programmer.

 * Used Open Data to generate visualisation system.
 * Used D3.JS to implement data parsing, SVG drawing and animations
